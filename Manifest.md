# The Open Source for Health Manifesto
We believe in sustainable health & care for everyone. That is why we believe in open source. These are our 5 design principles in open source for healthcare (OS4H)
1. Affordable healthcare over big profits
2. Transparency in security and privacy over black box software	
3. Independent access to your data over software dependent data
4. Integrations & standards over data silo’s
5. Proudly copied over not invented here
	
## 1. Affordable Healthcare over big profits
With many software vendors, in addition to the initial cost, you often pay licensing fees and an hourly rate for any changes you want to make. Even when other users have benefits of these changes. 
That means vendors of commonly used software earn a lot of money because they can sell a single change multiple times. Open source software does not have these costs, the business model focusess on hosting and services and not on development of new features

## 2. Transparency in security and privacy over black box software
Closed source gives little transparancy when using algorithms or when applying privacy policies to webbased services. When you have full transparancy of the security and privacy of any tool, these measures can be checked, challenged and improved by others.

## 3. Independent access to your data over software dependent data
When you have  third party software handling and/or storing your data (even under certain conditions) with closed source software, you lose full and limitless insight, control and access. 
Open Source Software gives everyone the ability to understand how data is handled and stored, so that the owner always can access, change or move the data. 

## 4. Integrations & standards over data silos
Every software supplier has its own interpretation of the international standards that leads to different methods of interoperabillity. Integrations are complex, especially when the source code is not available. 
For each data source you would like to connect, you need  specific expertise of that supplier to make the translation. With open data sharing, under strict access requirements, partners / the community can build and test connectors with shared definitions and structures.

## 5. Proudly copied over not invented here
Why should the other reinvent the wheel? When some organisation develops a smart solution in an open source community (and shares it publicly) the group can benefit. Everyone can contribute. 
Shared solutions that not completely fit, however can be an inspiration to change the project for one's implementation. 

## about the OS4H movement
### Our mission
We want to create a movement that develops software with open source standards, open source source files and prefers sustainable health(care) over profits. We will challenge the status quo and break vendor lock-in.

### Our vision
Patients and healthcare professionals are drivers of change. They experience and own the problems that we are currently facing in healthcare. We believe that healthcare’s IT needs to be in support of that experience. This is how we connect the technical world with patients and healthcare professionals, to deliver better solutions for sustainable healthcare.

### Open sourcecode, open standards
The Open Health movement works with open source codes and open standards. This means that everyone has insight into the structure of the software and standards so it is clear how data is handled and exchanged. 
This also means that everyone can contribute to improving software and developing new functionalities. 

### Community
Development takes place within the Open Health Community. A collaboration between user, developer and supporter. Together we work on products that best suit daily practice.
The software can also be adapted by anyone for different purposes. As a result, users and developers jointly determine the direction and roadmap of the solutions.

### Open Revenue model
The current vendor lock-ins are maintained by commercial parties (epic, chipsoft, medimap etc) that use traditional models in which software usage rights are purchased.
This model does not fit with the basic principles of the Dutch healthcare system: a single-payer healthcare system, financed with public funds based on accessibility, quality and affordability for all.
The philosophy of Open Health is therefore different and based on openness, reusability and transparency. 

That doesn't mean companies cannot or should not make money from ICT in Healthcare. It's just that they don't make money on user rights, but on the use of and services related to it. Think of SaaS, hosting and specific services.

### Some examples:
A hospital wants to use software for information exchange, only it lacks certain connections. 
A company is hired to use developers to build those specific features and make them available in the community. The developers are paid for their services. 
A hospital contracts with a company that makes a specific software package available to the hospital as a SAAS solution. The company guarantees availability, installation of updates and upgrades, and handles disruptions. The hospital pays a fixed amount per use of the module.
